# purescript-halogen-animations
Utility component for animating elements through CSS animations in Halogen applications.

This project is mostly based on [purescript-halogen-transition](https://github.com/nonbili/purescript-halogen-transition), with the main difference being the use of queries in order to toggle animations, helping decouple the state of the animated elements from the parent component. 

Example code can be found in the [example](./example) directory, and can be run with

``` sh
$ npm run start
```
